This project aims to bring the power of the Google Voice API to the Python language in a simple, easy-to-use manner.
Currently it allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemails/recorded messages, and search the various folders
of your Google Voice Accounts. You can use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for new received calls/sms,
or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.
